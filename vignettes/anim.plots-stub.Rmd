# Vignette stub

You can see the anim.plots vignette online at [github.io](https://hughjonesd.github.io/anim.plots/anim.plots.html). The
file size was too large to include in CRAN. If you want to build the vignette yourself, run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmd_file <- system.file("doc", "full", "anim.plots.Rmd", package = "anim.plots")
doc_dir <- "path/to/somewhere/appropriate" # e.g. your Desktop folder
rmarkdown::render(rmd_file, clean = FALSE, output_dir = doc_dir)
```

You can then view it in your web browser.

Be aware that anim.plots is just a simple wrapper around Yihui Xie's "animation"
package. You may want to consider more modern solutions such as [gganimate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gganimate).
